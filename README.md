Cloud Foundry Testing

## Getting started 

Assuming you've already received the email with your credentials in it, you'll want to install the cloudfoundry-cli package; This can be found here https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli, there are precompiled binaries if you scroll down slightly.  Following that, as suggested, login and change your password using the following two commands:-

- cf login
- cf passwd



## Notes on Crippledness

I don't have permission to do the following commands
- cf create-service-broker -  This, I believe, is how we add more services, We'd need this if we want to actually give people the ability to make their own services
